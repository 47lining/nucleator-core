nucleator-update(1)
===================

NAME
----
nucleator-update - localize Nucleator Stacksets from specified public or private git sources


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nucleator update'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Uses a manifest of Nucleator Stacksets, and a manifest of required Ansible Roles within each, to localize Nucleator Stacksets and Ansible Roles at the specified version from the specified public or private git repositories.

`nucleator update` is used to extend Nucleator to include or prefer customized and potentially private variations of Nucleator Stacksets and/or Ansible Roles.

Updating Nucleator Stacksets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clones each Stackset specified in `~/.nucleator/sources.yml` from the specified public or private git repository, at the specified version, placing the results in the specified named Stackset directory in `~/.nucleator/contrib`.

Each resulting directory in `~/.nucleator/contrib` is assumed to correspond to a Nucleator command, and will by dynamically loaded by the `nucleator` command line interface at each invocation.

Prior contents of `~/.nucleator/contrib`, if any, are uniquely renamed and moved to `~/.nucleator/contrib.bak`.

Updating Ansible Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nucleator Stacksets may specify one or more Ansible Roles that should be installed during the `nucleator update` process.  Ansible Roles listed in `<stackset_name>/ansible/roles/roles.yml` will be installed from their specified source at the specified version to the specified Ansible Role name.

Note that this is orthogonal to any Ansible Role dependencies stated using ansibles `meta` role dependency mechanism.  Ansible currently will not install roles included in `meta/main.yml` at playbook runtime.  `nucleator update` thus manages the invocation of Ansible's `ansible-galaxy install` command to install these roles within the Nucleator Stackset during the `nucleator update` process.

[[FILES]]
FILES
-----

~/.nucleator/::
	Configuration directory for local nucleator configuration.

~/.nucleator/sources.yml::
	Source specification for Nucleator Stacksets that should be installed
	by `nucleator update`.  For each Stackset to be included, specifies the
	location of the Stackset source (typically a private or public git
	repository), an optional version (typically a git branch or tag), and
	the name of the Nucleator command implemented by the Stackset.  Uses
	the same file format as `ansible-galaxy`.

~/.nucleator/distkeys.yml::
	Distibution keys that should be used while accessing private repository(ies)
	used in `sources.yml`.

~/.nucleator/contrib::
	Directory where those Nucleator Stacksets specified in `sources.yml` are
	locally materialized.

~/.nucleator/contrib.bak::
	Prior contrib directory structures are uniquely renamed and moved by
	`nucleator update` to this backup directory, to avoid any potential
	loss of data or local edits.

<stackset_name>/ansible/roles/roles.yml::
	Source specification for Ansible Roles that should be installed by
	`nucleator update` for Nucleator Stackset `<stackset_name>`.  Uses
	the same file format as `ansible-galaxy`.
