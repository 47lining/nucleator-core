SYNOPSIS

'nucleator account setup [options]'

[verse]
'nucleator account rolespec list' [options]
'nucleator account rolespec provision' [options]
'nucleator account rolespec validate' [options]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Implements AWS Account setup best practices by providing Nucleator commands that:

* enable Account-level best practices by establishing pre-requisite AWS
  resources for Nucleator usage and recommended Account-level AWS
  Services such as CloudTrail, detailed billing and (future) AWS Config;

* consistently use IAM Roles to establish minimally permissive access
  policies, together with required trust policies, that enable devops
  automation to span multiple AWS Accounts;

* provide consistent mechanisms to concisely and transparently specify required
  IAM Roles within Nucleator Stacksets;

* conveniently provision specified IAM Roles within an AWS Account, and
  validate that cross-account delegation via IAM Roles is functioning
  as expected.


SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

Subcommands provide for Account-level setup and role maintenance
activities that result in the creation of IAM Roles required for
proper functioning of Nucleator Stacksets.

ACCOUNT SETUP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`nucleator account setup` conveniently adds resources to the specified AWS Account that
enable best-practice usage of account-level AWS Services and that are
required to suppor Nucleator's use of AWS CloudFormation.

For usage details, refer to linknucleator:nucleator-account-setup[1]

IAM ROLE SPECIFICATION AND MAINTENANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`nucleator account rolespec` can be used to:

* list the specifications of IAM Roles and their associated access and trust
  policies that are required for usage of all installed Nucleator Stacksets,
  or a specified Nucleator Stackset.
* provision the IAM Roles required by all installed Nucleator Stacksets,
  or a specified Nucleator Stackset, into the specified AWS Account.
* validate that provisioned IAM Roles can be assumed and that temporary
  credentials can be obtained from the AWS Secure Token Service as required
  for Nucleator to operate across AWS Account boundaries in a secure manner,
  without requiring cross-account sharing of IAM User credentials.
