nucleator-builder(1)
====================

NAME
----
nucleator-builder - Install the builder stackset which includes the Nucleator and the Nucleator UI in a secure manner within a Nucleator build Cage.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nucleator builder' <cmd> [options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `builder` command and its subcommands provide a Stackset that includes Nucleator, Nucleator's User Interface and Artifactory.

The Nucleator resource is installed in a secure manner within a Nucleator `build` Cage.  This resource is used to execute Nucleator operations in much the same way you do from your own command-line/shell.

The Nucleator User Interface provides a Jenkins-based interface and job history for Nucleator-related actions.  It relies on the Nucleator resource for executing Nucleator operations.

The Artifactory instance provides a repository which will store binary artifacts.  These may be retrieved and deployed to beanstalk stacksets.
