==================

NAME
----
nucleator-setup - manage the site configuration files


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nucleator setup show'
'nucleator setup wizard'
'nucleator setup validate'

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Nucleator system relies on a set of files which describe the components
of your installation.  This is described in the User's Guide on the page titled
"Nucleator Configuration Process Overview"

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

SITECONFIG SHOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'nucleator setup show'::
+
`nucleator setup show` creates a rudimentary display of the existing
site configuration set of files.

SITECONFIG WIZARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'nucleator setup wizard'::
+
`nucleator setup wizard` asks you a series of questions enabling you
to simply create the suite of site configuration files.  Prior to starting
the wizard you should know what AWS accounts you will be using and for each
account you will need the account number, access key and secret key.  This
information can be read from the AWS Management Console.
+
In the simplest possible case, you can create one cage in one account,
in the region you select.  By entering the three
required fields (account number, access key and secret key), and selecting
default values, all the appropriate configuration files will be created for you.
+
For ongoing maintenance of the files, a good practice would be to create a Git
repository to store the files with verions.  This will also enable the Nucleator
User Interface to have access to the site configuration files.
+
As you run the wizard, default values, when present, are shown in brackets '[]'.
Just press enter if you want to use the default value offered.
+
If you want to create multiple cages, just enter a new cage name when asked, and
it will ask the questions for that cage.  Similarly, if you have multiple accounts,
you can enter the number and keys for each account.

SITECONFIG VALIDATE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'nucleator setup validate'::
+
Attempts to validate the existing site configuration including sources of updates
and distribution keys.  TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
