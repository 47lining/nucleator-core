NAME
----
nucleator-redshift - Provision Amazon Redshift clusters in Nucleator Cages


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nucleator redshift provision' <args> [options]
'nucleator redshift delete' <args> [options]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `redshift` command and its subcommands are used to create and maintain
Amazon Redshift clusters within Nucleator Cages.

Running `nucleator redshift provision` multiple times is safe, because 
provisioning and configuration operations are idempotent. If no changes 
have been made to the Stackset definition in `~/.nucleator/contrib/redshift`, 
these commands will result in no change.  If updates were made to to the 
Stackset definition (via `nucleator update`, for example) that are 
consistent with CloudFormation's "update in place" capabilities, the 
Stackset will be updated in place so that AWS Resources are brought 
into alignment with the new Stackset definition.

The `redshift` command provides the ability to easily manage
provisioning parameters supporting setup and common scaling operations
via the Nucleator CLI.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

REDSHIFT PROVISION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'nucleator redshift provision'::
	--customer <customer_name>
	--cage <cage_name>
	--cluster_name <redshift_cluster_name>
	--username <db_user_name>
	--password <db_user_password>
	[--cluster_type <redshift_cluster_type>]
	[--num_nodes <desired_number_of_nodes>]
	[--node_type <desired_node_type>]
	[--database_name <database_name>]
	[--encrypted <true_or_false>]
	[--public <true_or_false>]
	[--port <database_port>]
	[--preview] [-h | --help]
+
`nucleator redshift provision` creates an Amazon Redshift cluster 
in the specified Cage for the specified Customer.
+
The subcommand supports options that control the cluster size and type of 
instances to be used for cluster nodes.


REDSHIFT DELETE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'nucleator redshift delete'::
	--customer <customer_name>
	--cage <cage_name>
	--cluster_name <redshift_cluster_name>
+
`nucleator redshift delete` attempts to delete the `redshift`
Stackset instance specified by <redshift_cluster_name> from the
specified Nucleator Cage.


OPTIONS
-------

--customer <customer_name>::
	The name of the Customer for whom the specified Cage was provisioned.

--cage <cage_name>::
	The name of the Cage in which to provision and maintain the beanstalk.

--cluster_name <cluster_name>::
	The name of the Amazon Redshift cluster to provision,
	configure, deploy or delete. Note that nucleator will extend this 
	base cluster name appending "-<cage>-<customer>" to support AWS 
	naming best practices and ensure uniqueness within the target AWS 
	account. So for example if "mycluster" is passed as cluster_name, the 
	provisioned cluster will be named "mycluster-<cage>-<customer>".

--cluster_type <cluster_type>::
	The type of cluster to provision - either "single-node" or "multi-node".
	The default is "single-node".

--num_nodes <number_of_nodes>::
	The number of nodes to provision when deploying a multi-node cluster. 

--node_type <node_type>::
	The Amazon instance type to be used for provisioned cluster nodes. Valid 
	values are "dw1.xlarge", "dw1.8xlarge", "dw2.large" and "dw2.8xlarge". The
	default is "dw2.xlarge" which is eligible for AWS free tier usage.

--username <db_username>::
	The root username for the provisioned Redshift cluster. The username must 
	be between 1 - 128 characters, contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters 
	and cannot be a Redshift reserved word.

--password <db_password>::
	The root password for the provisioned Redshift cluster. The password must be 
	between 8 - 64 characters and must contain at least one number, one lowercase 
	letter and one uppercase letter.

--database_name <database_name>::
	The name of the initial Redshift database. Defaults to "defaultdb". The 
	database name must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, be 
	between 1 - 64 characters, and cannot be a Redshift reserved word.

--encrypted <true_or_false>::
	Controls whether data is encrypted at rest within the Redshift cluster.
	The default is "false".

--public <true_or_false>::
	Controls whether the provisioned cluster can be accessed from a public 
	network. The default is "false".

--port <port_number>::
	The port number to be used for the Redshift database. The default is 5439.

--preview::
	When provisioning a cluster, rather than provision the cluster,
	print preview information about what will be provisioned if
	run without the `--preview` opion.  Preview text is intended
	to be descriptive and may also include links to graphical
	architecture diagrams.

-h::
--help::
	Show help for this command.
