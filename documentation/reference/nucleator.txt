NAME
----
nucleator - create and manage secure, scalable, highly available environments in Amazon Web Services


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'nucleator' [--version] [--help] [-v | --verbose | -v[v*]]
    <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Nucleator is a devops framework that provides for the creation of secure,
scalable, highly available environments in Amazon Web Services (AWS), 
into which reusable stacks of components can be deployed to address common
cloud usage scenarios.  Each Nucleator Stackset implements an AWS Reference
Architecture, and provides for provisioning, configuration, and operations.

Nucleator makes it easy to partition environments across multiple AWS accounts
and to leverage a supported and maintained set of CloudFormation stacks that
work together to allow users to focus on their core problems.  It can be used to
rapidly implement common scenarios in brand new AWS Accounts so that customers
new to AWS can get started quickly while leveraging accumulated best practices.

Nucleator provides an extensible model for Stackset contributions from both
public and private communities.  Git is leveraged extensively for community-oriented
distributed development, versioning and release management of Stacksets.

OPTIONS
-------
--version::
	Prints the nucleator suite version that the 'nucleator' program came from.

--help::
	Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used
	commands. If the option '--all' or '-a' is given then all
	available commands are printed. If a nucleator command is named this
	option will bring up the manual page for that command.
+
Other options are available to control how the manual page is
displayed. See linkgit:nucleator-help[1] for more information,
because `nucleator --help ...` is converted internally into `nucleator
help ...`.

-v::
--verbose::
-v[v*]::
	Increase verbosity used for all commands / subcommands, as well as
	any invoked provisioning or configuration playbooks.  Multiple `v`'s
	may be specified for increased levels of verbosity.
