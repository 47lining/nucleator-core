# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups

# Most Nucleator Stacksets use AWS Linux, which uses ec2-user.
# Other distros vary - you can maintain ability to connect to other groups
# that you provision using different distros by adding a group_vars file
# for the corresponding group in inventory as part of your provisioning plays.
# That will override the default value defined here.
