# Nucleator private repository distribution keys and known hosts
#

# Distribution Keys enable Nucleator to read from private git repos.
# Nucleator can draw from multiple private repositories, and supports
# multiple distinct distribution keys for different repos served by the
# same host (e.g. private repositories at github)

# Each distribution key specified here will be made available in ~/.ssh/
# on the Nucleator instance within the builder Stackset, and in
# [TODO - describe how/where each distribution key is made available on Jenkins]
# on the Jenkins instance within the builder Stackset.

# Each specified distribution key includes the following key/value pairs:
#
# hostname - the hostname of the server that has provided the
#     distribution key.
#
# ssh_config_host - the host specified in ssh config, through
#     which hostname can be accessed
#
# distribution_keyfile - the name of the file containing the private
#     key to be used when accessing hostname via ssh_config_host.
#     Nucleator expects each such file to reside in ~/.nucleator/distkeys/ 

distribution_keys:

  # Private Enterprise Repository
#  - hostname: stash.mycompany.com # name of host to access
#    ssh_config_host: stash.mycompany.com # accessed via this name in ssh config
#    private_keyfile: mycompany.distkey.stash.mycompany.com.id_rsa # private distribution key

  # Customer Private GitHub Repository1
#  - hostname: github.com
#    ssh_config_host: github-repo1
#    private_keyfile: 47lining.distkey.repo1.github.com.id_rsa

  # Customer Private GitHub Repository2
#  - hostname: github.com
#    ssh_config_host: github-repo2
#    private_keyfile: 47lining.distkey.repo2.github.com.id_rsa

# All specified known hosts are added to ~/.ssh/known_hosts on the Nucleator
# and Jenkins instances, to provide secure ssh connections without requiring
# user validation of the fingerprint of the target server's private key.
# TODO use ssk-keyscan instead.  See roles/jenkins/tasks/ssh_setup.yml
