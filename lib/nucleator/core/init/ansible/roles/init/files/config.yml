# Nucleator Cage CIDR Whitelist
#
# Access to Nucleator Cages will be limited to those CIDRs listed here
NUCLEATOR_CAGE_CIDR_WHITELIST:
  - 0.0.0.0/0    # replace with whitelist entries

# To enable clean stack updates, if CIDR_WHITELIST changes,
# ensure INITIAL_RULENUM also changes such that new NACL rulenum
# values are entirely nonoverlapping with prior rulenum values
#
# Also take care not to exceed maximum number of rules per NACL
